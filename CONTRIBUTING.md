# Contributing to Disenchanter

## Translations

You can contribute translations for your language using the translation platform [Weblate](https://weblate.ms-ds.org/engage/disenchanter/).

**Steps:**
- Register by email or using GitHub SSO
- Choose an [existing translation](https://weblate.ms-ds.org/projects/disenchanter/disenchanter/) or [start a new translation](https://weblate.ms-ds.org/new-lang/disenchanter/disenchanter/)
- You will be presented with the English source text and can enter your language's translation
- To prevent abuse, your translations will be saved as suggestions that will regularly be accepted and merged by project maintainers.
- Make sure to place interpolated variables where appropriate
  - They look like this: `My name is %{name}`, so you'd translate like this: `Ich hei√üe %{name}`
